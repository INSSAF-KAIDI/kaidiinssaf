Implemented Firebase cloud logging, a React dashboard, and Stockfish integration. Led a 3-member team through end-to-end development (PCB prototyping, firmware, testing with 20+ users); optimized chess logic in Python and sensor polling, reducing power consumption by 40%.",

Analyzed 2,000+ suspicious domains using a 6-layer detection system with DNS forensics, TLS fingerprinting, and ML (XGBoost) â€” achieving 92% accuracy. Developed a Flask + Scikit-learn backend processing 50+ features (ASN, WHOIS, HTTP headers); deployed via Docker in cyber labs.",
